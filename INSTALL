On any version of Linux...
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
________________________________________________________________________________

On any version of Microsoft Windows >= Windows 10...

Make sure you have 'Windows Services for Linux' (wsl) enabled.

This is the 'official' way to install wsl

      1. Open Power Shell in Admin mode.
      2. Type "dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart"
      3. Press Enter.
      4. Type "dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart"
      5. Press Enter
      6. Type "wsl.exe --install
      7. Press Enter    (may take some time, you should end up with a minimal 
                         version of Ubuntu)

wsl should now be available by entering 'wsl' in the search box on the 
task bar.

I have just installed wsl on a new Windows 11 pc and the above did not work.  
This is what did work:

      1. Launch C:\Windows\System\control.exe
      2. Click on 'Install Applications'
      3. Click on 'Turn Windows features on \ off'
      4. Scroll down and check 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'
      5. Reboot
      6. Run Power Shell as Administrator
      7. Type 'wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu install wsl' and press ENTER

If all goes well you will be prompted for your Linux user name and password (This
should be different to your Windows login).   Now you can install the necessary
software as described below.
