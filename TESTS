I know this is not an efficient cube solver.  It is a version of the 'Beginers 
Method'.

By slightly altering the program I created the file 'moves.sql'.   The cube was
scrammbled for 100 moves and solved 100,000 times.  (I ran rubik with -t 0)!    
Thus 'moves.sql' was generated.

The file 'moves.sql' may be inported into MYSQL, and which shows the number of 
moves taken to solve the cube for each scrammble.      

So I now not only know the program will solve a cube from any possible 
position, but also just how inefficient this solution realy is!

The least moves taken was 53

The most moves taken was 231

The average number of moves taken was 141.33

2455 Solutions took 139 moves.
1249 Solution took  140 moves.
2505 Solutions took 141 moves.
1174 Solutions took 142 moves.
2521 Solutions took 143 moves.
